# Sentiment Analysis using Pretrained BERT Model

## Overview

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis using a pretrained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, particularly to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic is positive, negative, or neutral.

## Features

- Utilizes a pretrained BERT model for high accuracy in sentiment classification.
- Processes text data to predict sentiment labels.
- Provides an interactive Jupyter Notebook for easy execution and experimentation.
- Includes data preprocessing, model loading, and sentiment prediction steps.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Transformers Library (Hugging Face)
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch transformers pandas numpy scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Getting Started


1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Sentiment_Analysis_using_Pretrained_BERT_Model.ipynb
   ```

2. **Run the cells** in the notebook to load the model, preprocess the data, and perform sentiment analysis.

```

## How to Use

1. **Load the Data**: Ensure you have your text data ready for sentiment analysis. You can load your dataset in the Jupyter Notebook.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The notebook includes steps for preprocessing the text data, such as tokenization and padding.

3. **Model Loading**: The pretrained BERT model is loaded using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

4. **Sentiment Prediction**: Use the model to predict the sentiment of your text data.

## Example

Here is a brief example of how to use the notebook for sentiment analysis:

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
import torch

# Load pretrained model and tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Tokenize input
inputs = tokenizer("I love using BERT for sentiment analysis!", return_tensors="pt")

# Predict sentiment
outputs = model(**inputs)
predictions = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)

# Print the sentiment
if predictions.item() == 1:
    print("Positive sentiment")
else:
    print("Negative sentiment")
```
