## Overview
The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts a target variable from a dataset by:
1. Importing necessary libraries.
2. Loading and inspecting the dataset.
3. Preprocessing the data.
4. Training a Random Forest classifier.
5. Evaluating the model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

## Dependencies
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd your-repo-name
```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
4. Open `predict_target_variable.ipynb` and run the cells.

## Project Steps

### Importing Libraries
Import essential libraries for data handling, model training, and evaluation.

### Loading the Dataset
Load the dataset from a CSV file and display its structure.

### Data Preprocessing
- Separate features and target variable.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Standardize feature values.

### Training the Model
Initialize and train a Random Forest classifier.

### Evaluating the Model
Predict the target variable on the test set and calculate accuracy.

## Results
The modelâ€™s accuracy on the test data will be displayed, indicating its performance.
